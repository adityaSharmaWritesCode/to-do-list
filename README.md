# to-do-list

A web application I built to serve as an interactive to-do list. It has the all the required functionalities - displaying list of tasks already entered, highlighting the text area on focus, striking the items on the to-do list to mark it as done, as well as deleting finished tasks. The application was built using HTML, CSS & JavaScript.
